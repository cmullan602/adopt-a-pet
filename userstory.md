AS a pet/movie enthusiast 
I WANT TO search for a movie
SO THAT I can find out if a dog dies in it

WHEN I load the page 
THEN I search for a movie

WHEN I search for a movie
THEN I can print a picture of skull and crossbones based on if as dog dies or not 
THEN I can see a summary of the movie

WHEN I find a movie that a dog does/doesn't die
THEN I can save it based on those results I chose
